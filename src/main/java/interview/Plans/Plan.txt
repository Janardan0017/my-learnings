  - Max number using K swaps [3](https://nodeflair.com/companies/natwest-group/interviews/java-developer)
  - Euclidean distance calculation [3](https://nodeflair.com/companies/natwest-group/interviews/java-developer)

#### ✅ **Database & SQL**
- Writing queries (e.g., 3rd highest salary with conditions [3](https://nodeflair.com/companies/natwest-group/interviews/java-developer))
- Difference between `PRIMARY KEY` and `UNIQUE` [3](https://nodeflair.com/companies/natwest-group/interviews/java-developer)
