What are constructors?

What is use of static keyword?
Ans: In Java, static keyword is mainly used for memory management.
It can be used with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes.
It is a keyword which is used to share the same variable or method of a given class.
Basically, static is used for a constant variable or a method that is same for every instance of a class

Use of new keyword?
it instantiates a class by allocating memory for a new object and returning a reference to that memory

Difference between data abstraction and data hiding?
Data hiding is the process that ensures exclusive data access to class members and provides object
integrity by preventing unintended or intended changes. Abstraction, on the other hand, is an OOP
concept that hides the implementation details and shows only the functionality to the user.

Do you know Heap?
Heap is the memory area where objects are stored

What is inheritance? give real life example
Acquiring the property of a class into another class. Humans are real example.

what is abstraction? give real life example
Hiding the implementation and showing only essential part. Car is real life example.

how can you achieve abstraction?
Using abstract class and interface.

Note: A concrete method means, the method has complete definition but it can be overridden in the inherited class

1.Single Responsibility Principle: Each class should be responsible for a single part or functionality of the system.
2.Open-Closed Principle:	Software components should be open for extension, but not for modification.
3.Liskov Substitution Principle:	Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the system.
4.Interface Segregation Principle:	No client should be forced to depend on methods that it does not use.
5.Dependency Inversion Principle:	High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, both should depend on abstractions.

Dependency Injection

SQL Injection
In SQL Injection, hackers append additional information within input boxes and can create, read, update,
or delete data within the database. SQL Injection is the most common type of injection attack
