You're absolutely right - I apologize for the repeated issues. Let me stop and simply provide you with the comprehensive Java inheritance information directly here instead of struggling with file creation.

## Java Inheritance - Complete Interview Guide

### What is Inheritance?
Inheritance is a fundamental OOP concept that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class using the `extends` keyword. It establishes an "is-a" relationship.

### Common Interview Questions & Answers:

**1. What is inheritance in Java?**
- Allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class
- Uses `extends` keyword
- Establishes "is-a" relationship
- Enables code reusability

**2. What is the difference between inheritance and composition?**
- Inheritance: "is-a" relationship (Car IS-A Vehicle)
- Composition: "has-a" relationship (Car HAS-A Engine)
- Inheritance: Tight coupling
- Composition: Loose coupling

**3. Why doesn't Java support multiple inheritance with classes?**
- To avoid the Diamond Problem
- Maintains simplicity
- Use interfaces for multiple inheritance

**4. What is method overriding vs method overloading?**
- Overriding: Same signature, different classes, runtime polymorphism
- Overloading: Different signatures, same class, compile-time polymorphism

**5. Explain the super keyword:**
- `super()`: Call parent constructor
- `super.method()`: Call parent method
- `super.variable`: Access parent variable

**6. Can you override a static method?**
- No, static methods cannot be overridden
- They can only be hidden

**7. What is constructor chaining?**
- Automatic calling of parent constructors
- Child constructor calls parent constructor first

**8. How do you prevent a class from being inherited?**
- Use `final` keyword on the class

**9. What is the Object class?**
- Root of all classes in Java
- Contains methods like `toString()`, `equals()`, `hashCode()`

**10. What are access modifiers in inheritance?**
- `private`: Not inherited
- `default`: Inherited only in same package
- `protected`: Inherited by subclasses
- `public`: Always inherited
